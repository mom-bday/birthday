Happy birthday!

<br> I wanted to say thank you. Through all the ups and downs, whether through college applications or just keeping me on the right track, you’ve always been my biggest supporter and a mom that I could count on. 

<br> I know how hard it is to do what you do. But the truth is, our family wouldn’t be what it is without you. When you thank me for getting into the colleges I did, it feels backwards, because really I should be thanking you. None of it would have been possible without your guidance, constant support, love, and sacrifices you make that we don’t always see, but we always feel.

<br> Thank you for always putting our best interests first, for caring for us and making us feel loved. I’m not just saying this, but you’re truly the best mom out of anyone else. Me, Winnie, and Poppy wouldn’t be the same without you, and I want you to know that we appreciate you, and we’ll all put in the effort to show you that going ahead. We’re so lucky to have you as our mom (/wife), we need you in our lives, and we love you so much.

<br> <br> Love,

<br> Adi, Winnie, Poppy
